# qasmtools

`qasmtools` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Go for parsing and formatting OpenQASM 3.0 files. It provides functionalities to process QASM files, making them more readable and consistent.

## Features

* **QASM 3.0 Parsing**: Parses OpenQASM 3.0 files into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
* **QASM 3.0 Formatting**: Formats QASM 3.0 files to adhere to a consistent style.

## Installation

To build `qasmtools` from source, ensure you have Go installed (version 1.16 or higher recommended).

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/orangekame3/qasmtools.git
    cd qasmtools
    ```

2. Build the executable:

    ```bash
    go build -o qasm ./cmd/qasm
    ```

    This will create an executable named `qasm` in the current directory.

## Usage

The `qasm` executable provides two main commands: `fmt` for formatting and `parse` for parsing QASM files.

### Formatting QASM Files

To format a QASM file:

```bash
qasm fmt [files...]
```

Options:

- `-w, --write`: Write result to (source) file instead of stdout
- `--check`: Check if files are formatted without modifying them
- `-i, --indent`: Set indentation size (default: 2)
- `-n, --newline`: Ensure files end with a newline (default: true)
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output
- `--diff`: Display diffs instead of rewriting files

Examples:

```bash
# Format a file and print to stdout
qasm fmt input.qasm

# Format multiple files in-place
qasm fmt -w file1.qasm file2.qasm

# Check if files are properly formatted
qasm fmt --check *.qasm

# Format with custom indentation
qasm fmt -i 4 input.qasm
```

### Parsing QASM Files

To parse and validate a QASM file:

```bash
qasm parse <file>
```

Example:

```bash
qasm parse input.qasm
```

## Project Structure

* `cmd/qasm/`: Contains the main entry point and CLI implementation
* `parser/`: Handles the parsing of QASM 3.0 files and AST generation
  * `grammar/`: Contains the ANTLR grammar files for QASM 3.0
  * `gen/`: Contains generated parser code
* `formatter/`: Implements the QASM 3.0 formatting logic
* `examples/`: Contains example QASM files and usage examples
* `testdata/`: Contains test files for various QASM constructs

## Examples

Check out the `examples/` directory for sample QASM files and usage examples:

　- `examples/bell_state.qasm`: Implementation of a Bell state
　- `examples/grover.qasm`: Implementation of Grover's algorithm
　- `examples/ast_visitor/`: Example of using the AST visitor
　- `examples/error_handling/`: Example of error handling
　- `examples/parse_simple/`: Simple parsing example
