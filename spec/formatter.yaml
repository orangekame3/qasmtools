# OpenQASM 3 Formatter Specification

language: OpenQASM 3.0
style_reference: https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm/tree/main/examples

formatting_rules:
  version_declaration:
    - Place 'OPENQASM 3.0;' at the very top.
    - Follow immediately with include statements (one per line).

  indentation:
    - Use 2 spaces per indent level.

  spacing:
    - Add spaces around binary operators (=, +, -, *, /, ^, etc.).
    - No spaces inside brackets [], parentheses (), or braces {}.
    - Function or gate call parameters have no space between function name and parentheses.

  statements:
    - Terminate all statements with a semicolon.
    - One statement per line.
    - Do not combine multiple statements on one line.

  blocks:
    - Opening brace { stays on the same line.
    - Closing brace } goes on a new line with matching indentation.
    - Body content inside blocks is indented.

  declarations:
    - Each declaration should be on its own line.
    - Place array size (e.g., qubit[3]) immediately after type with no space.

  control_flow:
    - Add space after keywords like `if`, `while`, `for`, `switch`.
    - Wrap conditions in parentheses.
    - Each control-flow block follows standard indentation and bracing rules.

  delay_and_timing:
    - Timing unit expressions like `100ns` are written compactly.
    - Use square brackets tightly in e.g. `delay[100ns]`.

  comments:
    - Preserve all comments.
    - Inline comments use `//` with one space before.
    - Multiline comments `/* */` are preserved as-is.

  whitespace:
    - Insert one empty line between major blocks (functions, gates, for-loops).
    - Do not insert empty lines between variable declarations unless grouping is intentional.

  file_end:
    - Ensure the file ends with a newline character.
